# Data Analyst
The culmination of my journey at Syracuse University's School of Information Studies is on the horizon, with a Master's degree in Management Information Systems and Data Science. Here, I've honed advanced data management, analytics, and visualization skills. My educational endeavors have been complemented by developing and maintaining robust data pipelines using Azure Databricks at Casey's, supporting our team's pursuit of data-driven insights. As a former Data Analyst at Avalon Global Research, I embraced statistical analysis to inform market research, underscoring my commitment to delivering value through data. 

#### Technical Skills: Power BI, Python, SQL, R, Tableau, Databricks, AWS, Machine Learning, PySpark, Altyrex, Snowflake, MATLAB
#### Certifications: AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner, Databricks Certified Data Engineer Associate, Microsoft Office Specialist-Excel Associate (Office 2019), Snowflake Hands-On Essentials-Data Warehouse

**Python and ML intern @ ZS Microtech (_June 2021 - July 2022_)**
- Developed a Python GUI application integrating ML algorithms, leveraging Tkinter, matplotlib, NumPy, and pandas
- Recommended actionable insights from data inputs, constructed interactive visualizations using ggplot and seaborn, and 
delivered results to clients

## Projects
### Ransomware Detection using Machine Learning

Developed objective strategy for discovering optimal EEG bands based on signal power spectra using **Python**. This data-driven approach led to better characterization of the underlying power spectrum by identifying bands that outperformed the more commonly used band boundaries by a factor of two. The proposed method provides a fully automated and flexible approach to capturing key signal components and possibly discovering new indices of brain activity.

### Decoding Physical and Cognitive Impacts of Particulate Matter Concentrations at Ultra-Fine Scales
[Publication](https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/22/11/4240)

Used **Matlab** to train over 100 machine learning models which estimated particulate matter concentrations based on a suite of over 300 biometric variables. We found biometric variables can be used to accurately estimate particulate matter concentrations at ultra-fine spatial scales with high fidelity (r2 = 0.91) and that smaller particles are better estimated than larger ones. Inferring environmental conditions solely from biometric measurements allows us to disentangle key interactions between the environment and the body.
